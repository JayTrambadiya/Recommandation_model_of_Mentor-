For people who are looking for help in business development (especially SaaS), Alex is a real godsend.\n100% Recommended\n', '::\nAlex is a great startup mentor. His many years of experience working at startups, founding, and launching them is incredibly useful for mentoring startup founders. Alex knows a lot about building great cofounding teams, making a good impression as a founder, and validating a startup idea. He has helped me narrow down and discover more clearly my startup’s niche, as well as validate the business idea. His guidance also helped me improve my website and landing page, not only through its better design but also in its ’selling language’. I feel more confident approaching customers now, and this is all after about only 1 month of mentoring with Alex. I also learned to create a waitlist for my startup and signed up more than 50 people. His knowledge in startup strategy has helped me make better marketing decisions, including email, Instagram, and Facebook. As a bonus, although he claims otherwise, Alex has good ‘design’ knowledge as well (not only for our website but also on social media posts).\nIf you’re a mentee willing to put in the work (often hard work, like leaving your home to solicit potential customers face-to-face) ask the right questions, and listen to Alex’s advice, I recommend Alex and believe that he can be a great fit for your personal growth as a startup founder.\n']"

Chris Hammerschmidt,8,5.0,Data%20Analysis,"['machinelearning', 'datascience', 'productmarketfit']","['::\nChris is an excellent mentor! He is very knowledgeable and is able to explain complex concepts in a way that is easy to understand. He is also very patient and is always willing to answer any questions I have. I would highly recommend Chris to anyone looking for a machine learning mentor!\n', ""::\nChris has been a great mentor to work with! Before starting, I already worked as a data scientist, but was looking to deepen my understanding, create a continuous learning practice for myself, and be more confident in the enormous field of ML/DL. Chris really excelled at providing accountability, being a sounding board to create that practice, and in helping create more confidence in myself about the deeply technical parts of ML/DL.\nWe started by outlining areas of ML that I would want to expand my knowledge in and Chris helped encourage me to write up my readings in each subfield and ultimately helped create a practice of reading papers and really internalizing what was being communicated.\nOnce I became more confident in engaging with literature, I began to want to explore the practice of research. I came up with a problem and Chris acted as a great sounding board and mentor in this capacity to focus my idea. He lent his expertise in academia to help me understand how to progress on my ideas and I'm now working towards publishing my work.\nI really can't thank Chris enough for his help and mentorship over this journey. While I'm sure Chris could help anyone just starting out, I also think he would be a perfect fit for anyone who's already in the field, but is looking to go a lot deeper in their understanding and broaden their perspective on the field as a whole.\n"", '::\nChris is an amazing mentor who goes above and beyond in providing feedback, tips, and useful learning material. I came to Chris for help on a classification project, and he gave me extremely thoughtful tips and guidance on how to best approach it. Chris is also very responsive and easy to work with, I would highly recommend!\n']"
